<h1>qftp</h1>

<p><i>qftp</i> is a utility that performs file transfers using
<i>ftplib</i> based on instructions presented on the command line.

<h2>Format</h2>

<pre>
    qftp &lt;action&gt; &lt;host&gt; [ -l user [ -p pass ] ] { options/files }...

    Actions: send, get, dir, list, rm

    Options:
        -v level        Set verbosity
        -r rootpath     Change remote working directory
	-m umask        Set umask for created files
        -a | -i         Set ascii/image transfer mode
</pre>

<dl>

<dt>action
<dd>Specifies what <i>qftp</i> is to do.  <i>qftp</i> can <b>send</b>
files to a remote system, <b>get</b> files from a remote system, remove
(<b>rm</b>) files from a remote system, or retreive a <b>dir</b>ectory
of files or a <b>list</b> of files on a remote system.

<dt>host
<dd>Specifies the name of the remote system.  An alternate port may be
specified by appending a colon and the port name or number to the host
name.

<dt>-l user
<dd>Specifies the username to log in with on <b>host</b>.

<dt>-p pass
<dd>Specifies the password to log in with on <b>host</b>.

<p>If <b>user</b> is not specified, <i>qftp</i> will use
<b>anonymous</b>.  If <b>pass</b> is also not specified, <i>qftp</i> 
attempts to build a password from the translation of the environment
variable "USER" and the string returned by gethostname() separated by an
"@".

<dt>-v level
<dd>Specifies the verbosity level.  A level of 1 will cause <i>qftp</i>
to display messages indicating successful transfers.  A level of 2 will
cause FTP protocol responses to be displayed.  A level of 3 will cause
FTP protocol commands to be displayed.

<dt>-r rootpath
<dd>Sends a 'change directory' request to the remote server.  All
subsequent file names on the command line will be parsed relative to this
new directory.

<dt>-m umask
<dd>Sends a request to change the umask to the remote server.  This may
not be supported by all servers.  It is implemented using the 'SITE'
command in the FTP protocol.

<dt>-a
<dd>Requests that subsequent files be sent in ascii mode.

<dt>-i
<dd>Requests that subsequent files be sent in image mode.

</dl>

<p><i>qftp</i> may optionally be invoked through a softlink.  <i>qftp</i>
searches the command which invoked it for 'send', 'get' or 'dir' and, if
found, performs the requested function.  In this case, leave off the
<b>action</b> argument on the command line.

<p>For example; I use the following softlinks:

<pre>
    ln -s qftp ftpsend
    ln -s qftp ftpget
    ln -s qftp ftpdir
    ln -s qftp ftplist
    ln -s qftp ftprm
</pre>

<p> and then invoke transfers with 'ftpsend' instead of 'qftp send', etc.

<p>If no file names are specified on the command line, <i>qftp</i> will
read file names from stdin.  Use your favorite utility to generate a list
of files to send/retreive or type them interactively.
